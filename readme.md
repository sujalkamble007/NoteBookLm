# üìì Notebook-LM Clone  

Notebook-LM is an AI-powered platform that lets you upload, organize, and interact with knowledge sources. It uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to let you chat with your documents, web pages, texts and structured data. Built with a modern stack (MERN + LangChain.js + Qdrant + OpenAI), it offers an experience similar to Google‚Äôs NotebookLM but fully open-source.
